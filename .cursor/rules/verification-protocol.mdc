# Verification Protocol

## Mandatory Post-Task Reporting

Every task completion MUST end with this "Review Summary":

### 1. THE WHY
Architectural justification for the chosen implementation. Explain design decisions, trade-offs, and why this approach was selected over alternatives.

### 2. EDGE CASES
List 3 specific scenarios handled (e.g., nulls, timeouts, network failures, empty arrays, invalid inputs, concurrent modifications).

### 3. TEST PLAN
3-step manual verification plan:
- **Command**: Exact command or action to execute
- **Input**: Test data or scenario
- **Observation**: Expected result or behavior

### 4. AUDIT
Ask to generate Unit Tests or update Documentation. Ensure test coverage for critical paths and edge cases.
