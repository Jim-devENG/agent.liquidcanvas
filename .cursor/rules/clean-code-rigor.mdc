# Clean Code Rigor

## NAMING
Intent-revealing names only. No abbreviations. Use domain language. Boolean variables should be questions (e.g., `isValid`, `hasPermission`).

## MODULARITY
Functions > 40 lines must be flagged for refactoring. Extract complex logic into well-named helper functions. Keep functions focused on a single responsibility.

## COMMENTS
Document 'Why', not 'What'. All exports need docblocks. Explain business logic, not implementation details. Remove commented-out code.

## REFACTORING
Smallest diff possible. Use @codebase to match existing patterns. Maintain consistency with existing codebase style. Prefer incremental improvements over large rewrites.
